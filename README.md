# Genetic-Motif-Discovery

This project focuses on predicting whether a DNA base lies at the peak summit of a transcription factor in a Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiment. Given a DNA sequence, the model aims to determine if a specific base is located at the summit region associated with transcription factor binding.
